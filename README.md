# This is a basic Webpack Starter App

This is intended to be used as a starter for a basic
Webpack project using modern Javascript with Babel and
Sass. It also uses the webpack-dev-server.

This project is for hacking out basic apps in a dev
environment and there is no fancy prod setup.

## Getting Started

This project uses **Yarn** so you can
run `yarn` to install packages and
`yarn start` to start the server.
